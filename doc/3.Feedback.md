## Exercise 1: Giving Written Feedback (10%)

In this exercise, you are to record the feedback that **you wrote as a reviewer**. We _aren't_ checking for a polished piece of writing here -- what's important here is the content. You do not need proper English, spelling and grammar here!

> I really like Alex's app. It's very clean and well laid out. The animations when the graphs change are really nice, and the interactive information when hovering the cursor over points on the graph are really informative. Where I can see some improvement is on stability as some parts break depending on the input (selecting other countries sometimes causes the main plot to not render properly). Additionally, some parts of the scatter plot are overplotted, so the legend in the graph is not fully visible. This is also an issue with overlapping players on the scatter plot, but it's not a make it or break it issue with me. Overall I really liked Alex's app, I think it would be a good tool for people who want to see how players rank between leagues, and even within each league.

> I really like Ivan's app. The theme makes everything very clean and the interface is very fluid. I think that the second page (the rankings page) is actually the more interesting of the two pages. It gives some really powerful interactivity to the user and gives a value to the wines which I think is really useful. While it's interesting to see the distributions of the wines on the first tab, I think that it's most useful for big picture information from the dataset. I think that instead of having the second chart on the first page, integrating the data table onto the front page would be more intuitive and provide more information to the user.
